            <p>When they say the word happiness to me, I immediately remember one character from anime and manga called berserk. Guts who survived and the most deadly grip and challenged the heavenly monster. Future ordinary man without one arm and eye, he still fights to continue living in a cruel world. He has no fear of death because he knows that he will fight to the end. A good story of this manga is connected with the fact that its writer was lonely he had no friends or family and he gave all of himself to his work. For this, a deep bow to Kentaru Miura. He died at the age of 55, but his work will remain forever in this world. The song name is shadow by Pastel Ghost.</p>
