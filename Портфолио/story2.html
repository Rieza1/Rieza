        <h1>Story 2</h1>

        <p>One cool evening, while I was smoking in the park, a girl approached me. She wasn’t alone—her friend stood beside her. The girl smiled, but there was something strange, something elusive in her eyes.</p>

        <p>“Hey, do you have a cigarette? One for me and one for my friend, if possible,” she said.</p>

        <p>I froze for a moment but quickly pulled myself together. There was a slight uncertainty in her voice, as if she wasn’t sure whether she wanted to talk to me.</p>

        <p>“Of course,” I replied, handing her the cigarettes.</p>

        <p>She took one, passed the other to her friend, and then looked at me a little longer than she should have.</p>

        <p>“You were in the hospital, weren’t you?” she suddenly said, frowning as if trying to remember.</p>

        <p>I sighed, smiled, and nodded.</p>

        <p>“Yes, but don’t worry, I was just a nurse. I was helping take care of the patients back then.”</p>

        <p>She looked at me carefully, as if she could feel I was lying but wasn’t sure. Then she simply nodded.</p>

        <p>“Got it. Thanks for the cigarettes,” she said and lit one up.</p>

        <p>I watched as she took the first drag. I knew my face was familiar to her. But memory is a strange thing. Sometimes it erases what seems impossible to forget.</p>

        <p>A long time has passed, but I still remember that day, how I changed everything that was and everything that would be. After a long separation and a terrible accident, I decided not to tell my beloved about our past together. That was my decision.</p>

        <p>I remember how her mother cried and blamed me for everything right in the middle of the hospital waiting room. At that moment, I was reconsidering all my mistakes. Her words struck like a whip against bare nerves:</p>

        <p><i>“If it weren’t for you… if it weren’t for you…”</i></p>

        <p>I couldn’t answer her. I couldn’t say a word. In her eyes, I was responsible for everything: her daughter’s memory loss, the pain that engulfed their entire family, and my own collapse. And maybe she was right.</p>

        <p>I remember her father. He was worried but remained calm. Even after everything that happened, he tried to help me. He was always kind, always earned my respect. Whenever my beloved and I argued, he immediately stepped in, trying to help us resolve our issues. That day in the hospital, when she regained consciousness, I just looked at her and walked away. Her father watched me leave and said:</p>

        <p><i>“This is a mistake.”</i></p>

        <p>But I didn’t turn back. I left the hospital, leaving her in the past.</p>

        <p>I left. I couldn’t stay near her, pretending to be a stranger, seeing her empty gaze. I disappeared. Moved to another city, changed my phone number, changed my life. Or at least, I tried.</p>

        <p>But the past doesn’t die. It appears in dreams, in mirrors, in reflections in storefronts, in voices on the street. It returns on cool evenings when old men ask unexpected questions. It lingers in every exhale of smoke, in every memory I try to burn away, but which clings to me like fire to paper.</p>

        <p>That same cool evening, while I was smoking in the park, an unfamiliar old man approached me and asked:</p>

        <p>“Do you know her?”</p>

        <p>I laughed out loud, like a madman. Inhaled another puff of smoke and answered:</p>

        <p>“Right now, we are not acquainted.”</p>

        <p>The old man looked at me, pulled a cigarette from his worn-out jacket, and lit it. His eyes were faded, like old photographs, but they held understanding. He said nothing, just silently inhaled and exhaled thick smoke, watching me.</p>

        <p>“Do you still love her?” he suddenly asked, his voice carrying something I couldn’t immediately grasp.</p>

        <p>I was silent for a long time and then answered hoarsely:</p>

        <p>“Yes.”</p>

        <p>The old man nodded, as if he already knew the answer. He finished his cigarette, dropped the butt onto the pavement, and crushed it under his shoe.</p>

        <p>“If you love her, why don’t you fight for her?” he asked.</p>

        <p>I smiled wearily. How could I explain to him that sometimes fighting means letting go? That sometimes love is not about reminding someone of yourself but about leaving, giving them the chance to start fresh?</p>

        <p>But the old man didn’t wait for an answer. He just turned and walked towards the park’s exit, leaving me alone with my thoughts.</p>

        <p>She smiled once more, then turned and walked away. I stood there watching her disappear into the crowd.</p>

        <p>A long time has passed, but I still remember that day. I remember how I changed everything. I remember how I learned to let go.</p>
